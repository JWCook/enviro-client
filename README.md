# Enviro client
**WIP/Incomplete**

A python client for the [Pimoroni Enviro](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658489939).
This adapts examples from [enviroplus-python](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python)
and combines and exposes these features in a more pythonic interface.

Currently this package is mainly just for learning purposes.
